# SQL-Challenges

This repository is a collection of my solutions to HackerRank SQL challenges. It serves as a log of my SQL learning journey, where I practice concepts ranging from basic queries to advanced window functions. Each solution is written in PostgreSQL (unless specified) and explained with clean, readable code.

Feel free to explore, learn, and suggest improvements. Collaboration and feedback are always welcome!
